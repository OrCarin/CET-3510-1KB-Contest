;============
Init:    
   ser    temp         ; set all bits in temp to 1's.
   out    DDRB,temp    ; setting a bit as 1 on the Data Direction I/O
                       ;  register for PortB, which is DDRB, sets that
                       ;  pin as output, a 0 would set that pin as input
                       ;  so here, all PortB pins are outputs (set to 1)
   ldi temp,0b11111110 ; load the `immediate' number to the temp register
                       ;  if it were just ld then the second argument
                       ;  would have to be a memory location instead
   out    DDRD,temp    ; mv temp to DDRD, result is that PD0 is input
                       ;  and the rest are outputs

   clr    temp         ; all bits in temp are set to 0's
   out    PortB,temp   ; set all the bits (i.e. pins) in PortB to 0V
   ldi temp,0b00000001 ; load immediate number to temp
   out    PortD,temp   ; move temp to PortD. PD0 has a pull up resistor 
                       ;  (i.e. set to 5V) since it has a 1 in that bit
                       ;  the rest are 0V since 0's.
;======================
; Main body of program:
Main:
   in    temp,PinD     ; PinD holds the state of PortD, copy this to temp
                       ;  if the button is connected to PD0 this will be
                       ;  0 when the button is pushed, 1 otherwise since
                       ;  PD0 has a pull up resistor it's normally at 5V
   out    PortB,temp   ; sends the 0's and 1's read above to PortB
                       ;  this means we want the LED connected to PB0,
                       ;  when PD0 is LOW, it sets PB0 to LOW and turn 
                       ;  on the LED (since the other side of the LED is
                       ;  connected to 5V and this will set PB0 to 0V so 
                       ;  current will flow)
   rjmp    Main        ; loops back to the start of Main
